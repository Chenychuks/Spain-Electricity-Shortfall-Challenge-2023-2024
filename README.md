Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge 2023-2024

Overview
Welcome to the Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge 2023-2024 on Kaggle! This repository contains the code and resources related to the challenge, where participants aim to predict the expected electricity shortfall in Spain for the year 2023-2024. Accurate predictions are crucial for effective energy management and planning.

Challenge Details

Task
The main task is to build a predictive model capable of estimating the expected electricity shortfall over the specified period. Participants are provided with a dataset containing diverse features related to weather conditions, historical electricity usage, and other pertinent factors.

Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated based on a performance metric that assesses the accuracy of predicted electricity shortfalls compared to the actual values. Participants are encouraged to explore a variety of machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and time-series forecasting methods to optimize their models.

Dataset
Features
The dataset includes a range of features, such as weather data, historical electricity consumption, and other relevant parameters. Participants can leverage this information to train their models and make predictions.

Target Variable
The target variable is the electricity shortfall, representing the deficit between electricity demand and supply during specific time intervals.
